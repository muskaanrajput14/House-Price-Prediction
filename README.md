# House-Price-Prediction
This repository contains Python code for predicting house prices using the XGBoost algorithm. It includes both a standalone Python script (house_price_prediction.py) and a Google Colab notebook (House_Price_Prediction.ipynb). The script/notebook utilizes the California housing dataset and follows standard machine learning practices for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
