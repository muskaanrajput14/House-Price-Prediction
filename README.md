# House-Price-Prediction
This repository contains Python code for predicting house prices using the XGBoost algorithm. It includes both a standalone Python script (house_price_prediction.py) and a Google Colab notebook (House_Price_Prediction.ipynb). The script/notebook utilizes the California housing dataset and follows standard machine learning practices for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

# Overview
The repository contains the following files:

**house_price_prediction.py:** A Python script for house price prediction using XGBoost. It can be run locally in any Python environment.

**House_Price_Prediction.ipynb:** A Google Colab notebook containing the same code as the Python script. It can be opened and executed directly in Google Colab.

# Usage
To run the standalone Python script:

Ensure you have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Run the house_price_prediction.py script.
To run the Google Colab notebook:

Open the House_Price_Prediction.ipynb notebook in Google Colab.
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to execute the code cells.
Dataset
The script/notebook utilizes the California housing dataset, which is fetched using scikit-learn's fetch_california_housing() function.
